**A Python script for extracting data from invoices and outputting it to an Excel file.**

</div>

## üìñ Overview

This Python script processes invoice data, likely from image files (inferring from file structure and naming conventions), and accurately extracts key information. This information is then organized and written into a structured Excel spreadsheet.  The script aims for high accuracy in data extraction, possibly using OCR or other advanced techniques (this needs further investigation of the `main.py` code). The `colomnHeader.json` file likely contains the schema for the output Excel file, defining the column headers and their data types.


## ‚ú® Features

- **Invoice Data Extraction:** Processes invoice images or other data formats to extract relevant information.
- **Data Cleaning and Transformation:** Cleans and transforms extracted data to ensure accuracy and consistency.
- **Excel Output:** Generates a well-formatted Excel file (.xlsx) containing the extracted data.
- **Customizable Output:** (Likely) allows customization of output fields through configuration (needs confirmation via code review).
- **High Accuracy:** Aims for a high degree of accuracy in data extraction.


## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python
- **Libraries:**  (Requires analysis of `main.py` to identify specific libraries used for image processing, OCR, Excel manipulation, etc.)


## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x (version needs to be specified based on `main.py` requirements)
- Libraries:  (List the specific Python libraries used, determined by reviewing `main.py`)  Use `pip freeze > requirements.txt` if a requirements file is not present.  Add the command to install these libraries below.
- `colomnHeader.json` file correctly configured.


### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KrupalWarale/HighAccurancy-Invoice-extraction-Excel.git
   cd HighAccurancy-Invoice-extraction-Excel
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:** (Requires analysis of `main.py` for dependency requirements.  Replace with actual libraries and version numbers.)
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt  # Create requirements.txt if needed.
   ```

3. **Prepare Input:** Place your invoice data (images or other supported formats) in the `input` directory.  The format of the input data needs to be determined from the code.

4. **Run the script:**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

5. **Check Output:** The processed data will be in the `output` directory in Excel format.

```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The `colomnHeader.json` file defines the structure of the output Excel file.  Its contents and format should be documented.  (Analyze `colomnHeader.json` and describe its structure and the role of each key.)
