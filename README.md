**A Python script for extracting data from invoices and outputting it to an Excel file.**

</div>

## üìñ Overview

This script extracts key invoice data and writes it into a structured Excel sheet. It targets high accuracy, possibly using docling library, with a custom json `colomnHeader.json` defining the output schema and headers.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KrupalWarale/HighAccurancy-Invoice-extraction-Excel.git
   cd HighAccurancy-Invoice-extraction-Excel
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:** 
   ```bash
   pip install docling pandas
   ```

3. **Prepare Input:** Place your invoices pdf) in the `input` directory.  The format of the input data needs to be determined from the code.

4. **Run the script:**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

5. **Check Output:** The processed data will be in the `output` directory in Excel format.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The `colomnHeader.json` file defines the structure of the output Excel file.  Its contents and format should be documented.  (Analyze `colomnHeader.json` and describe its structure and the role of each key.)
